<p>Carm has been with Fleming GIS Consulting<sup>TM</sup> since their conception in 1998. Pursuing a lifelong passion for nature, they graduated from the Forestry Technician prohram at Sault College in 2020, planning on working in forest fire for the remainder of their life. After 8 months their knees disagreed and in 2021 they decided to pursue a more chair-based career in GIS, enrolling in the Fleming College's GIS program. Their love for the natural world has lead them to work out of a remote property in northern Ontario, where they plan to garden, go fishing, and admire the trees during the day and keep their capitalist GIS pursuits to the night-time when the trees are hard to see. They would love to bring their cartographic skills to the table to enrich your next project!  </p>

<h3>Kirkland Lake Trail Atlas</h3>
<h5>August 2021 - Present</h5>
<p>Utilizing their newfound GIS skills, Carm is in the process of creating an extensive all-season trail map of Kirkland Lake, Ontario. Through this solo project, they will be collecting open-source data to create initial navigation maps, using those maps to traverse the area over many seasons, and then publishing a newly designed and extensive map using their findings.</p>
