<p>Carm has been with The GIS Company<sup>TM</sup> sincee their birth in 1999. Pursuing a lifelong passion for nature, they graduated from the Forestry Technician prohram at Sault College in 2020, planning on working in forest fire for the remainder of their life. After 8 months their knees disagreed and in 2021 they decided to pursue a more chair-based career in GIS, enrolling in the Fleming College's GIS program. Their love for the natural world has lead them to work out of a remote property in northern Ontario, where they plan to garden, go fishing, and admire the trees during the day and keep their capitalist GIS pursuits to the night-time when the trees are hard to see. They would love to bring their cartographic skills to the table to enrich your next project!  </p>
