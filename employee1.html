<h5>Really nice mossy rock I saw the other day</h5>
<h3>May 25, 2007</h3>
<p>Check it out guys! Saw this beauty the other day in what felt like a once-in-a-lifetime encounter. So I was walking through the woods near the Misema River area and stumbled on this stunner. What a thrill! I know we usually cast votes for the annual calendar assignments but this one is going right in for May. I would say I don't make the rules but i totally do lol</p>
