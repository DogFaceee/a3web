            <h1>What We Do</h1>
            <p>We are all black belts in karate which makes us very talented map creators. Our process is to literally kick a piece of paper until the shoe marks creates the pattern of a map. It is truly a sight to witness but we do not allow spectators at this time. Below are a few examples that we have kicked to life:</p>
