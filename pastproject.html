            <h1>Aquatic Mapping of Loch Ness</h1>
            <h2>January - May 2021</h2>
            <img class="centerPic" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80227452/145106081-48b2b499-8906-4a75-b74f-eba7b666de0f.jpg" alt="LochNessMappingProject" width="250">
            <p>Fleming GIS Consultants agree, as most professionals in the field of mapping and geography, that cryptid locational analysis has been on the backburner of federally funded projects for long enough. In January 2021, our team began a thorough process of development of technology to thoroughly analyze the suspected natural habitats of these creatures to gain some concrete data. By February our highly advanced remote sensing technology, functioning through a number of satellites, were launched. We forgot to make the remote sensor things see through ice tho so we had to wait like 3 months for the Loch Ness ice to melt. After months of preparation an waiting around the office we finally processed our imagery to amazing results. You can see it, right? Right there in the top right corner?? In the words of Dr. Hyndman, our Remote Sensing specialist, "it helps if you squint."</p>
            <h1>Our Intern Steven's First Map</h1>
            <h2>November 2020</h2>
            <img class="centerPic" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80227452/145106086-e5c96c03-53e3-4210-aa0e-2c756a4eb04a.jpg" alt="StevesMapRIP" width="250">
            <p>Steven wasn't with us for long (due to tragic events around the inception of the Loch Ness Mapping Project, which we don't speak of) but he made a few maps that were definitely getting there! Like one was almost even legible. We are/were very proud of Steven for his accomplishments and hope they find him. </p>
            <h1>Technology Development: "Yes, It's a Farm"</h1>
            <h2>June 2019</h2>
            <img class="centerPic" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80227452/145106072-4479e5d9-f58d-4229-a298-807d96adfc19.jpg" alt="StevesMapRIP" width="250">
            <p>Since humans started integrating agriculture into their lifetyles thousands of years ago, the question has plagued us: Is that a farm? Even in the modern age, with advanced aerial imaging and remote sensing technology, specialists have had difficulty distinguishing between agricultural and non-agricultural land. Finally in 2018, Fleming GIS Consultants brought answers to the world. Through the development of highly specialized "technology", our FarmDetectPro program was released to the relief of thousands around the planet. The output of the FDP program is quite complex: a raster file that has non-farms symbolized in blue, and farms symbolized in this greenish-greyish blue color. In the years since its creation, many have reached out to thank us for our indispensable contribution to science and humanity as a whole. To them, we say: "u r welcome lol"  </p>
